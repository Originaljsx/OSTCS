This repository contains the analysis code and notebooks used for clustering oceanographic time series data from multiple NASA satellite missions. The work implements functional data clustering via hypothesis testing k-means to identify temporal patterns in sea surface salinity, temperature, chlorophyll, and sea surface height data.
